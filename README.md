# RAG_Model_Starwars
 This is a RAG Model which can be built on your local machine which enables you to create fine tuning model using Starwars Screenplay documents

This repository contains a fully self‑contained Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to build a Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline from scratch — themed entirely around Star Wars.
